# Getting Started

### Start exploring notebooks under the repo
[![Deploy(Owner) On Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnaraymad1%2Faz-copy-github-ml-notebook%2Fmaster%2F.cloud%2FazuredeployGitClone.json)
